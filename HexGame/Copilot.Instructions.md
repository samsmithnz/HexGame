# Copilot Instructions
# Do not remove comments from any code.
# Always use curly braces { } for if, else, for, while, and similar statements, even for single-line blocks.
# Always update the game rules in the help popup when adding new features or changing game mechanics.
# Don't use the `var` keyword for variable declarations; always specify the type explicitly.
